        "- The course is partitioned into eight modules.\n",
        "In each module, you will learn about specific statistical concepts, techniques, and interpretations.\n",
        "- Python labs are an important part of the course where you will learn to analyze large datasets.\n",
        "- By the end of this course, you should be able to:\n",
        "    1. perform efficient, effective, and adaptable data analysis using modern statistical programming languages such as Python and R.\n",
        "    2. interpret data analysis results appropriately.\n",
        "    3. Communicate data analysis results in writing and orally to non-technical statistical audiences.\n",
        "- Assignments in this course are as follows:\n",
        "    - Weekly homework - 20%\n",
